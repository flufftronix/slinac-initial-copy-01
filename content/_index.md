summary: The Trump Administration has, so far, been [unsuccessful in using federal law to block Safe Consumption Spaces \(SCS\) in Philadelphia](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/us/injection-safehouse-philadelphia-ruling.html). But now a PA Senator [wants to pass a statewide ban](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=S&SPick=20190&cosponId=30461&mobile_choice=suppress).<br><br>Communities ready to use SCS as a proven tool for [curbing the drug overdose crisis](/the-research) deserve empowerment, not restrictions. Act now to defend safe and supervised consumption--saving lives is not a crime!

Hello, my name is *[name]* from *[your town of residence and your zip code]*. I am calling today because Pennsylvania is in the midst of a drug overdose epidemic. *[Share personal story if you want]*.<br><br>

Our current approaches are falling short. On average, across our state, one human life is lost to overdose every 120 minutes.<br><br>

Communities across Pennsylvania need the help safe consumption spaces provide. Research has demonstrated that after these facilities are implemented, communities see decreases in overdose rates, public injection, and discarded syringes.<br><br>

Senator Williams’ plan to prohibit these facilities is dangerous and irresponsible. A federal judge has determined that these spaces are legal. I urge Senator Williams not to stand in the way of this necessary public health intervention. *Saving lives is not a crime.*<br><br>

Hello, my name is *[name]* from *[your town of residence and your zip code]*. I am calling today because Pennsylvania is in the midst of a drug overdose crisis, and safe consumption spaces are needed in communities across Pennsylvania.<br><br>  

Our current approaches are falling short. On average across our state, one person dies every 120 minutes from drug overdose. *[Share personal story if you want]*.<br><br>

Research has demonstrated that after these facilities are opened, communities see decreases in overdose rates, public injection, and discarded syringes. On October 2nd a federal judge, the Hon. Gerald Austin McHugh, Jr. ruled safe consumption spaces do not violate federal law.<br><br>

In response to this ruling, Senator Anthony H Williams' is attempting to specifically deny Pennsylvania communities the benefits these facilities will provide. I urge you to refuse any support Sen Williams' bill, and further to sign this letter endorsing safe consumption spaces as a necessary, medical, fact-based intervention for fighting the drug overdose epidemic. *Saving lives is not a crime.*<br><br>

>Pennsylvania is in the midst of a drug overdose epidemic. On average, one person dies every 120 minutes due to drug overdoses in PA. Our current approaches are falling short. As individuals and organizations, we see safe consumption spaces (SCS) as a vital, evidence-based tool in reducing drug overdose deaths.<br><br>

>Over 30 years, a dozen countries and over 100 spaces, research has demonstrated the benefits for communities home to SCS. After these sites are opened, their neighborhoods see decreases of up to 60% in overdose rates, decreases in public injection, and decreases in discarded syringes. These areas also do not see increases in crime or active drug user populations.<br><br>

>In October of 2018 a nonprofit group called Safehouse announced plans to open a SCS in Philadelphia. And in February of 2019, a Trump-appointed attorney general sued Safehouse to block such a space from opening. A case in federal court followed and on October 2nd the Hon. Gerald Austin McHugh, Jr. ruled that SCS do not violate federal law. “I cannot conclude that Safehouse has, as a significant purpose, the objective of facilitating drug use,” he wrote in his opinion. “The ultimate goal of Safehouse’s proposed operation is to reduce drug use, not facilitate it. Safehouse plans to make a place available for the purposes of reducing the harm of drug use, administering medical care, encouraging drug treatment, and connecting participants with social services.”<br><br>

>Days later, Pennsylvania State Senator Anthony Williams announced plans to propose banning SCS in Pennsylvania, stating, “Let us not forget that heroin remains an illegal drug and a deadly killer of Pennsylvanians across the commonwealth. In the midst of an epidemic, we should not be providing spaces for users to continue to use without requiring treatment.”<br><br>

>We find Sen Williams’ logic misinformed, dangerous and irresponsible. Overdoses from fentanyl are robbing us of our loved ones. Too many people have died from preventable deaths, and will continue to die without spaces where drug users will be cared for during their times of highest risk. I oppose harmful policies which seek to block safe consumption spaces from communities who need them. *Saving lives is not a crime*.<br><br>
