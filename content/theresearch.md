title: The Research on Safe Consumption Spaces
subtitle: Safe consumption spaces (SCS) are medical facilities where individuals can use drugs under medical supervision. They are an evidence-based solution to decrease deaths due to drug overdoses, public injection, and discarded needles. Over 100 SCS exist in 12 different countries and there have been no deaths on site.

image_description: H17 Supervised Consumption Site, Copenhagen Denmark (*Kasper L*ø*ftgaard, Vice)
summary: Thirty years of evidence show safe consumption spaces have decreased rates of overdose fatality, public injection, discarded needles, and contractions of HIV and Hepatitis C. Increases in crime have not been found, but increased participation in drug and alcohol treatment programs has. Below is a summary of the research on the above topics.

## Overdose Deaths

* Overdose prevention sites decrease overdose deaths [^1]
* In the thirty years of SCS existing, no overdose death has been recorded in an SCS [^1]
* In Vancouver, Canada an SCS decreased overdose deaths by 35% around the site [^2]
* In Sydney, Australia the number of ambulance calls for overdoses decreased by 65% after an SCS opened [^3]

## Neighborhood Health

* Overdose prevention sites decrease public injection and the number of needles in the neighborhood of an SCS [^1]
* The amount of discarded syringes and people injecting in public decreased by 50% in Vancouver [^4]
* Residents and business owners in Sydney saw a decrease in public injection and the number of needles in their neighborhood after an SCS opened [^5]
* Drug users report that they used in public and discarded syringes less after an SCS opened [^6]


## Infectious Disease

* Overdose prevention sites decrease the risk of transmitting blood born illnesses like HIV and Hepatitis C [^7]
* They decrease skin and soft tissue infections like abscesses, and cellulitis [^8] [^9]

## Treatment and Recovery

* Various studies have shown that SCS increase the amount of users in detoxification and treatment programs because of effective case management and linkage to drug treatment programs [^10] [^11] [^12]
* Over three years, an SCS in Canada helped get 67% of individuals using the site get into drug treatment services; 23% stopped injecting drugs [^12]

## Crime

* All evidence suggests an SCS will not increase crime, drug trafficking, and the number of users in the neighborhood of the site [^1] [^13] [^14]
* No increase in crime and drug trafficking occurred after an SCS opened in Vancouver, Canada [^13]
* Researchers in Sydney, Australia monitored drug trafficking and the number of people using drugs around an SCS for 10 years and did not detect an increase in crime or the number of drug users in the area. [^14]
