(Philadelphia) Safe consumption sites were ruled not to violate federal law by Judge McHugh in Federal Court on October 2, 2019. This was viewed as an historic win for groups aiming to curb the drug overdose epidemic--in 2018, there were a total of 1,116 overdose deaths in Philadelphia alone. However, after the ruling Federal prosecutor William McSwain vowed to arrest anyone using a site if opened, hearkening back to failed policies around the “War on Drugs.” Many groups nationwide and local organizations are waiting to open safe consumption sites as a way to safely address drug use and ultimately save lives.

In observance of World AIDS Day on December 3rd, 2019 a coalition of groups - Angels in Motion, BRIDGES (Baltimore), Baltimore Harm Reduction Coalition, VOCAL-NY, SOL Collective, Friends of Safehouse, Prevention Point Pittsburgh, ACT UP Philadelphia, Center For Popular Democracy (D.C), AIDS United (D.C), DC Fights Back (DC) and the Opioid Network have all condemned his threats to intimidate people who use drugs from accessing this life saving facility. In response, national groups and community members will mass at the office of William McSwain at 615 Chestnut St at 11AM to remind him that the "War on Drugs" was racist and a miserable failure. Intimidating threats of arrest only stand to stigmatize people who use drugs, generate overdose deaths and fuel HIV and hepatitis C infections.

William McSwain will be presented with a funeral wreath, golden urn by ACT UP Philadelphia, and letters from the coalition organizations demanding he not arrest the most vulnerable people who do not want to die from drug overdoses. In 2018 77,000 people across the US died from overdose, with over 4,400 in the state of Pennsylvania and nearly 1,200 in Philadelphia. "These deaths can be avoided once there is a safe and sanitary facility for people.. to do what they have to do indoors” said Leon Tyer of ACT UP. He further added "I just saw someone inject on the Broad Street subway and he appeared to be homeless. Fortunately, I carry Narcan in my bag, but didn't need it. In Philadelphia we are in the midst of a homeless crisis and people who use drugs are doing it publicly and risk overdose death.”
